## Objectives

The course gives an introduction to machine translation going from statistical to neural machine translation systems and paying special attention to the current state of the art. A strong background on mathematics, statistics and machine learning is not required but a basic knowledge is expected to follow the course.
<br>

## Evaluation

The evaluation consists of X assignments and a final exam:
* SMT assignment (x%). Due in XXX
* NMT assignment (x%). Due in XXX
* ...
* Final exam (x%). Date to be announced
<br>
