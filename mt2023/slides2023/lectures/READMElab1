README

The [Ubuntu 22.04 bins] link contains a folder with all moses and mgiza binaries generated by compiling the sources in an Ubuntu 22.04.
Download moses, unzip this file (bin.zip) and put the unzipped folder (bin) in moses main folder (mosesdecoder) so that you have:
  mosesdecoder/bin
This should be plug and play using a cluster or a virtual machine with Ubuntu.
Otherwise, compilation in Ubuntu requires following the developers instructions but downloading and installing from source the last version of boost
instead of the one in the instructions.
  
  
The [Results] link contains the files generated by moses and giza after training the engines en2fr and fr2en using the data of the lab.
Notice that the data and its pre/post-process is not included.  Follow the lab tutorial to obtain them.
Files have been slightly modified from the real training outputs. They will not match 100% your outputs. Only use these ones in case of need.
